# modal-decomp

A **pure-Python** collection of simple scripts (no MPI, minimal dependencies) for extracting coherent flow structures via modal decompositions:

- **Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD)**
  Solves the cross-spectral density eigenvalue problem to yield energy-ranked, harmonic spatial modes under the assumption of wide-sense stationarity.
  _Reference:_ [Towne, Schmidt & Colonius (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04393)

- **Bispectral Mode Decomposition (BSMD)**
  Extracts third-order phase-coupled spatial modes by diagonalizing an estimated bispectral density tensor, revealing the triadic interactions that drive nonlinear energy transfer.
  _Reference:_ [Nekkanti, Pickering, Schmidt & Colonius (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15091)
  If FFT blocks are already present in `results_spod/`, BSMD automatically reuses
  them (printing "Reusing cached FFT blocks...") and writes new output to
  `results_bsmd/`.

- **Space-Time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (ST-POD)**
  Generalizes POD to a full space–time framework by solving eigenproblem of the space-time correlation tensor, capturing arbitrary nonstationary and transient dynamics over finite windows.
  _Reference:_ [Yeung & Schmidt (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09746)

## 💾 Getting the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardofrantz/modal-decomp.git
cd modal-decomp
```

## Installation

Install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install h5py matplotlib numpy scipy tqdm
```

These scripts were tested on **Python 3.13** running on **Ubuntu 24.04** and **macOS**.

## Running Tests

Install the dependencies and run the unit tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

### Parallel Execution

Set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to control how many threads
are used for FFT and SPOD computations. If the variable is unset or invalid,
all detected CPU cores are used by default:

```bash
# Linux
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc)
# macOS
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

### Script Usage

The analysis scripts (`pod.py`, `spod.py`, and `bmsd.py`) can now be executed in
separate stages. Each accepts the flags `--prep`, `--compute`, and `--plot` to
run only the desired part of the workflow:

```bash
python pod.py --prep      # preprocess input data
python pod.py --compute   # perform the decomposition
python pod.py --plot      # generate figures from results
```

Running a script with no flags executes all steps in sequence. The same options
apply to `spod.py` and `bmsd.py`.

## 🧐 Developer Notes

This section summarizes how the repository is organized and the mathematics implemented. It is intended for contributors extending the code.

### Code layout

- `spod.py`, `bmsd.py` and `pod.py` implement Spectral POD, Bispectral Mode Decomposition and standard POD respectively.
- `utils.py` provides the `BaseAnalyzer` class with common routines for loading data, computing FFT blocks via `blocksfft`, and saving results.
- `configs.py` contains global settings such as output directories, plotting defaults and the FFT backend.
- The `fft/` folder houses backend-specific FFT helpers.

### Mathematical overview

**SPOD** solves an eigenvalue problem for the cross–spectral density matrix. FFT blocks of the signal are computed with Welch's method (`blocksfft`). For each frequency bin `f_i` the weighted matrix
\[M_i = X_i^H W X_i\]
is diagonalized to obtain spatial modes and their energies.

**BSMD** analyzes triadic interactions. For a triad `(p1,p2,p3)` with `f_{p1}+f_{p2}=f_{p3}` it forms matrices `A` and `B` from cached FFT blocks and solves
\[C = A^\dagger W B,\quad C a = \lambda a.\]
The resulting eigenvectors reconstruct two coupled sets of spatial modes.

**POD** performs a weighted singular value decomposition of the mean-subtracted snapshots. Depending on the dimensions it solves either the temporal or spatial covariance problem and projects the data to obtain modes and time coefficients.

### Caching

Intermediate FFT blocks (`qhat`) are stored in HDF5 files whose names are generated by `make_result_filename`. Both SPOD and BSMD check for an existing cache before recomputing, and BSMD can reuse SPOD caches. This greatly speeds up iterative analyses and ensures reproducibility.

### Threads and performance

FFT computation uses the backend specified in `configs.py` and honors the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. The helper `get_num_threads()` returns the effective number of threads used.

### Extending the code

- New decompositions can be developed by subclassing `BaseAnalyzer`.
- Place cached data and figures in the respective `results_*` and `figs_*` directories.
- Override any global option via a JSON or YAML file passed to `configs.load_config()`.
- For BSMD, adjust the `ALL_TRIADS` list or provide your own set of frequency triplets.

By documenting these design choices, new contributors should be able to navigate the project and implement future updates more easily.
